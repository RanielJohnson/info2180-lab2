     <p>"Squid Game" is the a Korean series that released in the year 2021. The plot follows hundreds of Koreans in debt whom are invited to compete against each other in childrens' games over the period of 6 days. The winner of the games gets a tempting prize of over 45 billion Won(Korean currency) however deadly high stakes await whosoever joins these games. The players are scouted by a man who approaches them and asks them to play a small game and rewards them handsomely if they win. After the game is done the scouter than hands them a card to with contact information if they choose to gain higher rewards for competing in the Squid Games.</p>
     <p>The games are held on an isolated island and the players are kept in check by soldiers wearing red jumpsuits and masks with the shapes; cube,triangle and circle that represent the job they do. If a player is eliminated from a game or fails to complete the game within a given time, they are elimated, and elimination in the squid games means death. The players may be given the minimum requirements to stay alive and their movements in the facility where the games are kept are limited and supervised. Altho their treatment may seem inhumane the players themselves signed contracts agreeing to these conditions for the sake of the grand prize of billions of dollars, enough to pay off their debts and live luxurious lives; the journey however is not as charming.</p>

Joe, the protoganist of the series is in his twenties, he grew up in foster homes until he got adopted by a bookstore owner. He now manages the book store in New York. Coming from a broken home and an weird attachment to his mother who abandoned him, he easily grows attached to women who he thinks show the slightest interest in him. He would often have thoughts in his head about what they are thinking or how their lives are and even stalk them.</p>
     <p>Joe eventually finds himself in the lives of these women and tries to change whatever he can to try and make them happy or in his eyes the best versions of themselves. He will try to have them distance themselves from persons whom he thinks are just pure toxicity in their lives or even resorting to killing them if he just cannot get rid of them. He is constantly faced with situations where these womoen might find out about his ossessions and stalking and tries to hide his insecurities which usually just all end up out in the open and his plans fumble. Whenever this happens he would just start all over again like a predator in search of another prey.</p>
